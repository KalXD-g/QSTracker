# Path Tracker Project
## What It Is
Welcome to the Path Tracker Project! This is a handy tool that helps you track and visualize different pathsâ€”like a treasure map, but without the pirates! It uses some interesting ideas from science, showing how things can exist in many places at once.

## Features
- **Path Tracking:** This project can show multiple paths at the same time, inspired by concepts from quantum superposition.
- **Interactive Visualization:** Watch paths move and change in real-time, making it easier to understand how algorithms work.

## Future Plans
Add a tracker function that starts tracking form the goal point which works along with tracker from start point to reduce time.
